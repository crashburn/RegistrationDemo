This repo contains a simple application I'm writing to teach myself Spring MVC and Spring Web Flow.  I'm also learning to use JPA in CloudFoundry.  The application is for demonstration purposes only.

I've included the project metadata (all of the .* directories and files) from the Spring Tool Suite, 
but if you want to run in a different tool you can ignore those. 

I've also attached a software license in case anyone finds something they want to reuse.  The license 
is there for the warranty/liability clause more than anything else; I'm not particularly concerned 
about someone stealing the intellectual property.
